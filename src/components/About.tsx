        <p>
        My name is Umm-e-Fizza. I am 24 years old and from Karachi. I belong to a simple, respectable family. I completed my intermediate studies at APWA Government Girls College. Currently, I am pursuing certifications as a Cloud Applied Generative AI Engineer from GIAIC and as an Autonomous AI Agent Developer from PIAIC. By nature, I am a simple and quiet person. I am someone who loves animals and have two cats of my own. My only dream in life is to become capable enough to provide anything my family, my pets, and my best friend may ever need. And, InshaAllah, I will certainly become capable, as I always have the prayers of these loved ones with me at all times.</p>

        <h1>About Our Friendship</h1>
        <br />
        <p>Our first conversation took place on March 8, 2019, on a social media platform, Instagram, and that‚Äôs where our friendship began. Initially, we only chatted on Instagram, until one day, during a game of truth or dare, I gave my number to Bakhtawar‚Äôs sisterü§£ then Bakhtawar asked, "Why, You didn't give it to me first!" ü§£
And that‚Äôs how we exchanged numbers. Our friendship grew from Instagram to WhatsApp, and soon we were messaging each other daily. Over time, we became closer, and we grew attached to each other‚ù§Ô∏è

The first time we met was on November 6, 2021, when she visited Karachi with her mother. After that meeting, we started video calling too. I promised her that I would visit her home in February. So, on February 15, 2022, I went to her home in Daharki, Sindh, with my aunt and sister. This was our second time meeting. After that, our friendship deepened even more, and we became as important to each other as our families are to us. We started talking on video calls daily, sharing every detail of our lives. Like any close friendship, we sometimes had disagreements or misunderstandings, but as they say, misunderstandings come with closeness.

On February 8, 2023, she got married MashaAllah ‚ù§Ô∏è. Unfortunately, due to certain circumstances, I couldn‚Äôt attend, but I continued to support her from a far, Alhamdulillah. Just four months after her wedding, her father passed away. As They say that in difficult times true friends stand by your side. On April 24, 2023, we met for the third time. I wanted to be there for her in her grief, to help lessen her sorrow. I have always supported her, and she has always supported me, reminding me of even the smallest things to take care of myself. She encouraged this quiet person to open up and connect with others, and engage more with the world. Truly, Allah guides us, but He uses people as a means, and through Bakhtawar,I grew even closer to Allah, and now, MashaAllah, I even offer Tahajjud.

Misunderstandings and disagreements happen in every friendship or relation, and we also had our share. After I returned from her place, due to a misunderstanding, we didn't speak or stay in touch for three months. But Alhamdulillah, she came back to me, and we resolved everything together. As they say, misunderstandings occur only in true and close friendship, and when Allah creates such a bond, no amount of misunderstanding or any person can break it.

No matter what the world thinks of us, what they call us, whether they understand us or not, or even call us immature, the bond we share‚Äîour friendship‚Äîis something that only the two of us and Allah, truly understand. My prayer is that Allah, who brought us together and kept us close even when we were apart, continues to protect our friendship and shield us from any harm or negativity. Ameen‚ù§Ô∏èü´Çüßø</p>
